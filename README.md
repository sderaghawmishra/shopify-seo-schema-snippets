# ðŸ§  Shopify SEO Schema Snippets

A powerful, flexible, and modular set of **JSON-LD schema snippets** built specifically for **Shopify themes**. This repo helps developers and merchants implement structured data across product pages, business info, reviews, FAQs, and more â€” with complete control, full fallback logic, and no dependency on apps.

Whether you're building a custom Shopify theme or optimizing a live store for SEO and rich results, this is your toolbox.

## âœ¨ Why This Project?

Shopify themes often miss or bloat structured data, especially when relying on review apps or third-party integrations. That leads to:

- Invalid schema warnings in Google Search Console  
- Missed opportunities for rich results (stars, FAQs, breadcrumbs, etc.)  
- Duplicate `review` or `product` types in the DOM  

This repo fixes that with **clean**, **modular**, and **smart fallback-driven** snippets for every common schema type, ready to plug into any Shopify theme.
